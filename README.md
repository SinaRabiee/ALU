# ALU using VHDL
In this project, we implement a 16 OPCODE ALU in VHDL.

## ALU combinational 
In this folder we have the actual VHDL project of the ALU `Combiantional circuit` (using combinational gates) in `ISE` along with various block diagrams and test benches.
You can read more about the project in `Task1 Report.pdf`.

## ALU Sequential 
In this folder we have the actual VHDL project of the ALU `Sequential circuit` (using flip-flops) in `ISE` along with various block diagrams and test benches.
You can read more about the project in `Task2 Report.pdf`.

## ALU Combinational Variable Shifts
In this folder we have the VHDL project of a 5 OPCODE ALU using `Combinational circuit`, capable of performing shifts with variables for deciding hae many times.
You can read more about this in `Bonus Report.pdf`.
